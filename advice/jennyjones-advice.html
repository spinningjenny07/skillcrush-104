			<h4>Don't Give Up</h4>
				<p>There is  LOT to learn when you're first starting to code. Details, details, details. <br> There will be days when you feel like you'll never understand or be able to do anything real with your new skills.<br> Don't give into discouragement. <br> It will eventually make sense and then you can do some really cool stuff with code!</p>
			<h4>Pick Something and Stick with It! (AKA: Fight Shiny Object Syndrome!)</h4>
					<p>There are SO many languages, SO many technologies, SO many ways you can go on your coding journey. <br> So, when you first start out, pick one thing and learn it and then move on to something else. <br> Don't jump around to different languages when you first start. <br> Pick one and learn it well because then, you can transfer what you learn to any other language.</p>
			<h4>Find Support</h4>
				<p>Don't Code Alone! <br> Find friends you can code with! Go to a meetup and get some help. <br> It's a lot more fun to code when you can share your work with others and have the chance to get ideas from other people's work as well!</p>
